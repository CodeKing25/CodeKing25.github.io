        <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
        <p>I'm Diego Reyna, a Software Engineering student at Tecnológico de Monterrey with a passion for technology, problem-solving, and innovation. Growing up in Aguascalientes, I discovered my love for coding, which led me to explore how technology can change the way we interact with the world.

          Over the years, I've worked on various projects in fields like game development, web development, and multi-agent systems. From developing robots in my school to building educational apps for museums, I enjoy blending creativity with technical expertise. I also have a strong interest in collaborative environments, where teams come together to solve challenges and bring ideas to life.
          
          When I'm not coding, you can find me on the basketball court or exploring the latest in gaming and AI.</p>
